The UI is organized into a multipage streamlit app.

The pages cover the main functionalities of the code. 

Some pages do not yet have code implemented for them: they represent a concept more than a functionality. Such pages are `About`, `Benchmarking`, `Challenges` which are currently only writing, markdown and images and do not require further documentation.

Pages that have fully implemented code and functionality are the following:

- Maps
- Classifiers
- Gallery
- Logs
