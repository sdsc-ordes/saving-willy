# Release Protocol

We use 2 spaces on hugging face: one for the development of the interface and the main space for showcasing the most recent stable release. The main branch is protected and deploys to the main space when a PR is accepted.

We wish to enforce strict commits from the dev branch to the main branch when a PR is made to create a new release.

Dev to Main PR Checklist:

1. Open a PR from dev branch to main branch
2. Commit: in `dataset/download` change the `dataset_id` to point to the main dataset : `Saving-Willy/main_dataset`
3. Commit: in the ReadMe, to avoid merge conflict, change the header to this  : 

```
