# About
    We created this web app in [a hackathon](https://sdsc-hackathons.ch/projectPage?projectRef=vUt8BfDJXaAs0UfOesXI|XyWLFpqjq3CX3zrM4uz8). 
    
    This interface is a Proof of Concept of a Community-driven Research Data Infrastructure for the Cetacean Conservation Community. 

    Please reach out on [the project Github issues](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/saving-willy/issues) for feedback, suggestions, or if you want to join the project.

# Open Source Resources

## UI Code
    - The [space is hosted on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Saving-Willy/saving-willy-space). 
    - The [UI code is available on Github](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/saving-willy).
    - The [development space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Saving-Willy/saving-willy-dev) is also hosted publically on Hugging Face.

## The Machine Learning Models
    - The [model](https://huggingface.co/Saving-Willy/cetacean-classifier) is hosted on Hugging Face.
    - The [original Kaggle model code](https://github.com/knshnb/kaggle-happywhale-1st-place) is open on Github as well. 

## The Data

(temporary setup, a more stable database is probably desired.)
    - The dataset is hosted on Hugging Face.
    - The [dataset syncing code](https://github.com/vancauwe/saving-willy-data-sync) is available on Github.
